                <h3>10. JURISDICTION.</h3>
                <p>You expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute with AHWA, or in any way relating to your use of this Site, resides in the courts of the State of Florida and you further agree and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the courts of the State of Florida in connection with any such dispute including any claim involving AHWA or its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, officers, directors, telecommunication providers, and content providers.</p>
                <p>These Terms are governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

                <h3>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</h3>
                <p>If you have any concern or dispute, you agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us. If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of receipt by us, any resulting legal actions must be resolved through final and binding arbitration, including any question of whether arbitration is required, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. Claims related to the Terms, Services, or Site are permanently barred if not brought within one year of the event resulting in the claim.  </p>
                <p>JAMS will administer the arbitration in Miami Dade County, Florida pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. JAMS, formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. is a United States-based for-profit organization of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services, including mediation and arbitration. There will be one arbitrator that you and AHWA mutually select. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, but any witness whose native language is not English may give testimony in the witness’ native language, with simultaneous translation into English (at the expense of the party presenting the witness). Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered and will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction having jurisdiction over you and us.</p>
                <p>You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your or others’ unauthorized access to or use of the Services or Site in violation of the Terms, you agree that we are entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
